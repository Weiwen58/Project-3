Method 				ArrayList 	Runtime 		LinkedList Runtime 		Explanation

boolean add(T element)		O(N)			O(N)				One loop is operated in both lists 

boolean rotate(int n)		O(NÂ²)			O(N)				ArrayList operates nested loop while Linked List operates three non-nested loops

void merge(List<T> otherList)	O(N)			O(N)				Non-nested loops are operated in both lists which indicate the linear complexity

void reverse()			O(N)			O(N)				One loop is operated in both lists
